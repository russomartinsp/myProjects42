# myProjects42
My projects for 42SP

We have to use a set of rules, so maybe it's not a usual way to code.
Here I'm showing what I did and what I'm working in, from the Piscine (the process to enter 42school) to the last project tha I'll do for 42.

I'll update my progress while doing the projects, maybe someone will see my logic being made somewhere and it's going to be on my own language (portuguese).

In the future, I'll also add explanation on my files.
